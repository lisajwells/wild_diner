Wild Diner caters to the growing community of people who forage for raw food in the wild. (This group includes nature lovers and foodies.) 

The application provides a platform for foragers to share food sightings, allowing other members of the community to know what to search for in a given region and season. (This is in contrast to existing foraging apps, which are curated databases of plant information, and not location-generated.) 

Wild Diner is building a community of wild food enthusiasts so users can find food wherever they are.

Wild Diner was developed by Lisa Wells as the final project in the General Assembly Web Development Immersive course.
